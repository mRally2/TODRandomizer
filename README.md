   <p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong></p>
   <hr>
   <ul>
      <li>The replacement of the string "PRESS ENTER (TO BEGIN)" works only if you launch the game with keyboard controls</li>
      <li>San Francisco Escape doesn’t have a night setting available due to not being implemented by the original developers</li>
      <li>Las Vegas Rival Race, Las Vegas Alley Escape, and Chicago Downtown Escape don't have a time of day change due to VisEnv overlaps</li>
      <li>Out of bounds and wrong way detection is set to off since some of the time of day settings change assets of the map which leads to slightly different patterns<br><br></li>
   </ul>
